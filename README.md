# Grammar Development Final Project: English Relative Clauses

_Group members: Ema Nesic, Romaisaa Ahmed, Yeganeh Salehi_

## Introduction

With the assignment prompt of accounting for a linguistic phenomenon in xle structure, our group looked to capture English relative clauses: seeing that all three members have different native languages, we reasoned English grammatical constructions would serve well as a common denominator. Additionally, we chose to look at relative clauses, a cross-linguistic phenomenon that, in addition to not having been previously discussed in the present course, is syntactically straightforward and may be implemented in our existing grammar.


### Relative Clauses
Relative clauses refer to some clause that modifies a preceding entity, indicated in English by relative pronouns (i.e., who, when, that) - this is illustrated in the sentence "I see the forest **where**
I used to hike", where the pronoun **where** modifies _the forest_.
