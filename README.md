# Grammar Development Final Project: English Relative Clauses

_Group members: Ema Nesic, Romaisaa Ahmed, Yeganeh Mohammad Salehi_

## Introduction

With the assignment prompt of accounting for a linguistic phenomenon in xle structure, our group looked to capture English relative clauses: seeing that all three members have different native languages, we reasoned English grammatical constructions would serve well as a common denominator. Additionally, we chose to look at relative clauses, a cross-linguistic phenomenon that, in addition to not having been previously discussed in the present course, is syntactically straightforward and may be implemented in our existing grammar.


### Relative Clauses
Relative clauses refer to some clause that modifies a preceding entity, indicated in English by relative pronouns (i.e., who, when, that) - this is illustrated in the sentence "I see the forest **where**
I used to hike", where the pronoun **where** modifies _the forest_.


## Part I - Motivation

Having looked at the relevant c-structure for relative clauses, we deduced that this embedded clause must occur within the noun phrase (NP); thus, the NP had to be modified to accomodate this optional information, as an utterance may be grammatical in either reading (i.e., "the man slept" vs. "the man who ate slept").
Additionally, relative clauses are composed of a marker clause as well as a recursive sentence structure - these are denoted as C and S, respectively.

## Part II - Implementation


Our first goal therefore was to represent the most basic of relative clause examples, "the man who ate slept": here, the subject of the embedded relative clause is __the man__.

Next, we looked to capture the passive construction, exhibited in the sentence "the bone that was thrown shattered".

## Part III - Remaining Challenges and Future Refinement

In some instances, these embedded relative clauses may be accompanied by the relevant punctuation (i.e., "the man who ate, slept"); because the relative positions of the words are illustrated in the syntactic tree (i.e., whether a verb occurs in the matrix or embedded clause), we reasoned that punctuation may be omitted; this, however, may be implemented in a future project.
